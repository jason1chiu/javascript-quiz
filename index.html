      The quiz consists of only 5 multiple-choice questions and you have 1 minute to complete the quiz. When you click "Start", a timer will appear below the quiz. Your score is based on how much time you have remaining. You also have the option to view the previous record high scores with the person's initial, which we will also ask you to do too.
